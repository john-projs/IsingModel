# 2D Ising Model, fun personal project to learn C++.

This project aims to simulate a 2-Dimension Ising Model using Monte-Carlo methods(The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms). It is made to run in parallel, using all available CPU resources to increase speed, 
in the future I will implement this for CUDA to allow the use of GPGPU and decrease runtime further.

## Installation

Only standard C++ libraries are used in this project for now, I have compiled using MSVC with OpenMP enabled.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

## Testing

Tests should be implemented in the future...at some point
